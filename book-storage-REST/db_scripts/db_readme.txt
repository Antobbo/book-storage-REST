Database
-Open you db editor (MySQL workbench here)
-create a connection
-create the DB
	-Run create_db.sql
-Run use books_2020
-Run location_id.sql
-Run books.sql
This creates the db ad tables.
In my location_id I have the following locations:
(1, 'DOWNSTAIRS'), (2, 'UPSTAIRS_FIRST_BEDROOM'), (3, 'UPSTAIRS_SECOND_BEDROOM'), (4, 'UPSTAIRS_SPARE_ROOM'), (5, 'ON_LOAN');
So if you're happy with that you can run location_id_population.sql
